* trmor2018.train: Semi-automatically generated morphology dataset randomly split and used
  in experiments of [https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07946].

* handtagged: Manually annotated subset used to measure accuracy of trmor2018.train. Please
  do not use this file in experiments, it is only intended to measure the accuracy of
  trmor2018.train. More importantly **please do not copy any data between trmor2018.train
  and trmor2018.gold**, otherwise we will lose our ability to evaluate data quality on an
  independently tagged subset.
